Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis

Project Problem
Recruiters spend too much time manually screening resumes, scheduling interviews, and tracking candidate progress.

Proposed Solution
HireSmart â€“ A Salesforce-based Recruitment Management System that:
- Stores candidate, job, and interview data
- Automates interview scheduling & communication
- Provides analytics dashboards for HR teams
- Offers candidate self-service portal (LWC)
- Supports integration with external APIs (resume parsing, job boards)

Stakeholders
- **Admin**: Configures org, manages users
- **Recruiter**: Posts jobs, reviews candidates, manages interviews
- **Hiring Manager**: Approves candidate selections
- **Candidate**: Applies for jobs, tracks application status

Industry Analysis
- Traditional ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) exist but are expensive.
- HireSmart is lightweight, Salesforce-native, and can be adapted for colleges, startups, or SMEs.
